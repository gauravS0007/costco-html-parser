          "And the food? You’ll find everything from high-end sushi to artisanal barbecue to every taco variation imaginable.",
          "Austin is home of the state’s largest outdoor restaurant, The Oasis on Lake Travis, with seating for 3,000 between its multilevel patio and indoor dining areas, and spectacular views throughout the day and evening.",
          "Another great spot for sunset views (and bats; see “Batty bridge habitat”) is the Congress Avenue Bridge, which spans Lady Bird Lake downtown, while the city’s skyline is dominated by the 307-foot tower on the University of Texas campus and by the dome of the state Capitol, which is larger than the U.S. Capitol.",

          "For indoor pursuits, the university campus has two outstanding libraries, the LBJ Presidential Library, named for the Texas native, and the Harry Ransom Center, where one of only 20 Gutenberg Bibles is on display, along with film and literary collections and artwork."

          "You can walk or bike the out-and-back-trail to the missions, situated roughly 2.5 miles apart. Or book a guided kayak tour as the trail follows the path of the San Antonio River. From the Alamo, it’s an easy walk to the downtown River Walk, a promenade lined with restaurants, shops and public art installations.",
          "Two-thirds of the population in San Antonio is Hispanic; the city lays claim to the largest Mexican market in the United States (of course—Texas), El Mercado, also known as Market Square. It offers everything from handmade crafts and clothing to authentic Tex-Mex food.",
          "The city also takes pride in its German heritage. The King William neighborhood boasts architecturally elaborate homes built by prominent German merchants in the late 1880s.",
          "Adding to the city’s international flavor are a number of restaurants with kitchens helmed by graduates of the Culinary Institute of America, which has one of its three locations here. The school itself offers several food options, including a bakery/café and its high-end Savor restaurant, which remains reasonably priced."

As a result, for several months each year, more than a million bats live under the bridge. It is the world’s largest urban bat colony. Just before sunset each evening during “bat season” (yes, it’s a thing), the bats blanket the sky as they head out to forage for food. It has become one of Austin’s most popular attractions!—PG"

The company offers products that include wet and dry dog and cat food, grain-free dental chews and treats.",

I couldn’t see it, I could never believe it.\nI used to be fearless, Not afraid of anything, Until I saw you lifeless there. I loved you completely, And I gave you everything, And still you left me unaware.\nI feel nothing, nothing at all. You said nothing, nothing at all.\nHelplessly numb, Your battle hidden from view. No one could see it, No one could believe it. We’ll never have the answers, But the question still remains, What led you to your despair?

          "The kitchen is often called the heart of the home due to its central role in our daily lives. Food is prepared, shared and consumed here, but it’s also a place for everyday living. Kitchens are versatile, multipurpose spaces that also serve as workstations for chores, crafting, schoolwork and working from home.",
          "The team behind Costco’s Countertop Installation program keenly understands that if the kitchen counter is where you are rolling out the cookie dough and helping the kids with their homework, that counter needs to be a durable, high-quality product that enhances your home’s aesthetics, functionality and value.",
          "Cosentino, the company behind Costco’s program, has been operating in North America for more than 25 years and has a presence around the globe. It focuses on natural stone, quartz and Dekton, an innovative material designed to minimize or eliminate carbon emissions throughout its life cycle (see “More about Dekton”).",
          "Through Costco’s Countertop Installation program, the process for members who want to upgrade their countertops is remarkably easy and convenient. “All of the big decisions are made in one appointment in the comfort of your own home,” says Kelly Martin, Cosentino’s national account director. “It’s truly white-glove service.”"

          "The first step is to go to Costco.com, click “Shop” and in the drop-down menu under “Home & Installation Services,” click  “Countertop Installation.” Fill out the form on that page to request a complimentary, in-home consultation. Alternatively, you can initiate the process by calling 1-877-433-1377.",
          "You will either speak to, or be contacted by, your local Cosentino dealer, who will get the ball rolling with some easy questions about your wishes and requirements. You and the dealer will set up an appointment with a design specialist, who will come to your home and work with you to select the best options for you and your space.",
          "“You basically have a designer on your team,” says Martin. “They are well-versed in what materials are best for your purpose, not just the latest trends, and do a great job to make sure the member is happy in the long run.”",
          "During your appointment, the design specialist will take detailed measurements, review samples with you, finalize the design with you and confirm the project costs."

          "As with any home remodel project, having new countertops installed correctly is the key to success and longevity. Cosentino dealers complete the project according to the design plan you and the specialist came up with, and anyone who enters your home through the program will be a trusted professional.",
          "“We put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into building this network of dealers that we trust,” says Martin. “They’re long-standing partners of Cosentino’s and they’re vetted through a formal background check process. Given Costco’s high standard of service, dealers are required to hold all licenses required to operate and install by federal, state and local regulations.”",
          "You can get transferable warranties on all Cosentino products. There is a 15-year warranty available for Cosentino’s natural stone counters, and a 25-year warranty for the company’s Silestone (quartz) and Dekton countertops. If you decide to sell your home, a transferable warranty on a new kitchen countertop might just be the thing that seals the deal with potential buyers.",
          "When the job is completed, not only is there a gorgeous counter to enjoy for years to come, you’ll also receive a Costco Shop Card for 10% of its cost."

He says that instead of members spending time and energy getting quotes from multiple contractors and hoping to find someone they trust, Costco carefully selected Cosentino to work with because of their commitment to providing quality countertops and expert installation.",

          "Sustainability is a core value at Cosentino. The company has many green initiatives, but here are a few worth mentioning: One-third of its production includes reused and recycled materials, making it the only company in the industry with its own waste management and treatment plants; all products are manufactured with 100% certified renewable electric energy and its solar park produces the equivalent of the energy usage of 42,000 households. Cosentino also recycles 99% of the water used in production processes, achieving “zero level” water discharge in rivers and seas.—AT"

          "Dekton is a high-performance material composed of a unique blend of quartz, porcelain and glass particles. It is renowned for its exceptional durability and resistance to scratches, stains, heat and UV radiation. It’s also nonporous, which means low maintenance and easy cleaning. What’s more, it is resin-free, so no need for sealers. Dekton is available in a range of colors and finishes, making it a versatile and attractive choice for kitchen or bathroom countertops that combine both aesthetic appeal and practical functionality.—AT"
