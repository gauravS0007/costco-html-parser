## Scaling to 15,000+ Files

### Current Limitations
1. **Single-threaded Processing**: Sequential file processing
2. **Memory Accumulation**: All results held in memory simultaneously
3. **No Progress Tracking**: Limited visibility into large batch progress
4. **No Resume Capability**: Must restart from beginning if interrupted

### Required Improvements for Large Scale

#### 1. Parallel Processing Implementation
```python
from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def parallel_processing(file_list, batch_size=100):
    """Process files in parallel batches"""
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=cpu_count()-1) as executor:
        # Process in batches to manage memory
        for batch in chunk_list(file_list, batch_size):
            futures = [executor.submit(process_file, file) for file in batch]
            yield from [future.result() for future in futures]
```

#### 2. Database Integration
```python
# Replace JSON file storage with database
import sqlite3
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

class ResultsDatabase:
    def __init__(self, db_path):
        self.engine = create_engine(f'sqlite:///{db_path}')
    
    def store_result(self, file_result):
        # Store structured results with indexing
        pass
    
    def get_processing_status(self):
        # Track progress and enable resume
        pass
```

#### 3. Memory Management
```python
class MemoryEfficientProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_memory_mb=500):
        self.max_memory = max_memory_mb
        self.current_batch = []
    
    def process_with_memory_management(self, files):
        for file in files:
            result = self.process_file(file)
            self.current_batch.append(result)
            
            if self.get_memory_usage() > self.max_memory:
                self.flush_batch_to_storage()
                self.current_batch.clear()
```

#### 4. Progress Tracking and Resume
```python
class ProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self, total_files):
        self.total_files = total_files
        self.completed = 0
        self.failed = 0
        self.checkpoint_file = "processing_checkpoint.json"
    
    def save_checkpoint(self):
        # Save current progress state
        pass
    
    def resume_from_checkpoint(self):
        # Resume processing from last checkpoint
        pass
```

#### 5. Error Handling and Retry Logic
```python
class RobustProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_retries=3):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.failed_files = []
    
    def process_with_retry(self, file_path):
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            try:
                return self.process_file(file_path)
            except Exception as e:
                if attempt == self.max_retries - 1:
                    self.failed_files.append((file_path, str(e)))
                    return None
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```
